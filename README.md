# pcc-life-expectancy

A QUICK experiment using some open data sets from Plymouth City Council to show life expectancy by neighbourhood over the years the dats is available.
 
If I have time, I might expand on it and add some charts or somesuch.

No build-process / minification on this, it's just a quick prototype!

Any issues, please fix via pull-request!
